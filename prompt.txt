- Architecture: Microservices and Azure Functions
- Infrastructure: Azure Bicep or Terraform

**Requirements:**
1. Create a logical folder structure for a monorepo containing:
   - /services (API microservices)
   - /functions (Event-driven background tasks)
   - /web (Angular 21 frontend)
   - /infrastructure (IaC scripts)
2. Provide a 'weather-service' example in .NET 10.
3. Provide an Azure Function (Timer or Queue triggered) in .NET 10.
4. Provide the Dockerfile for the microservice and the 'az function' configuration.
5. List the CLI commands to provision this to Azure (Resource Group, App Service, Function App).

Ensure the code follows Clean Architecture principles.
